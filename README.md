# Notes from the reading in Code Fellow

## *This is where I will put all my notes I guess..*

Hello all, this is my GitHub portfolio: [Ttray310 GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/ttray310). My name is Tim Traylor (he/him). Currently living north of Seattle in Washington State. Iâ€™m a 12 year Navy veteran, submarine nuclear electrician. Looking to change fields to something with more remote possibilities for the future. Running Windows 10. Excited to see what area of coding is most interesting to me.

**Growth mindset** is the idea that I know that I am constantly growing and learning. *It is okay to fail*, but never okay to quit. Continue to improve daily and a month from now, you will be surprised.

### Reminders to stay in Growth Mindset

* Nothing comes easy
* Try to remember every one started at square one
* Focus on small wins, they win the war
