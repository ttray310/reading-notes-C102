# Notes from the reading in Code Fellow!

* This is where I will put all my notes I guess.. *

Hello all, this is my GitHub portfolio: [Ttray310 GitHub Portfolio](https://github.com/ttray310). My name is Tim Traylor (he/him). Currently living north of Seattle in Washington State. Iâ€™m a 12 yr Navy vet, submarine nuclear electrician. Looking to change fields to something with more remote possibilities. Running Win 10. Excited to see what area of coding is most interesting to me.

**Growth mindset** is the idea that I know that I am constantly growing and learning. _It is okay to fail_, but never okay to quit. Continue to improve daily and a month from now, you will be surprised.

Reminders to stay in Growth Mindset:
- Nothing comes easy
- Try to remember every one started at square one
- Focus on small wins, they win the war
