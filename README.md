Growth mindset is the idea that I know that I am constantly growing and learning. It is okay to fail, but never okay to quit. Continue to improve daily and a month from now, you will be surprised.

Reminds to stay in Growth Mindset:
- Nothing comes easy
- Try to remember every one started at square one
- Focus on small wins, they win the war
